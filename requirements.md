** Requirements for the application

- Understand the MVVM concept and edit the code.
- After migrating the code into the View folder, the splash screen doesn't work anymore. Fix it.
- Databind all the data.
- Enable adding new locations and let it save.
- Fix the UI, (maybe using grid and stack panel) so it will fit well for both mobile and tablet dimensions.
