search page

* from what database will it look for the city?
is it list of city inside the json file?
do we look at API documentation?

* I need search to be binded with the result in the listview.

* when I click on a city, it should lead back to the updated main page
(do I do this by replacing the city in the API address?)

favourite page

* from the main page, make tap action to change the icon

* from the main page, make double tap action to move to favourite page.

* on favourite page, have city name and its heart icon.
if a city name is clicked on the listview, direct to the updated main page/
